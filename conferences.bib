  abstract = {This presentation discusses an approach for detailed scour risk analysis of creek crossings for design of large diameter water transmission lines. Discussion includes risk categorization and methodologies utilized, including the City of Austin’s erosion hazard zone methodology and the United States Bureau of Reclamation Guidelines for evaluating pipeline channel crossing hazards to ensure effective burial. The presentation describes how tailored scour analysis for the Alliance Regional Water Authority’s Phase 1B treated water pipeline segment A resulted in informed design decisions, lower construction costs, and thoughtful creek crossing restoration.},

  abstract = {An experiment to evaluate the use enzyme induced carbonate precipitation (EICP) for coastal erosion mitigation was conducted in the large wave flume at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University. The surface of a model sand dune was stabilized using EICP. The test slope was 7.2~m long, 1.8~m wide, and 1.5~m high (measured from the mean water level) and was composed of a local uniform fine beach sand. The slope surface was treated via EICP to form an approximately 5~cm-thick crust. In addition to crust formation, a 0.38~m-deep, 0.8~m in breadth zone at the toe of the slope was treated in lifts using EICP to form a toe wall across the 1.8~m width of the flume. The erosion resistance of the treated slope was tested by applying 20 wave trains of progressively increasing intensity. The crust remained intact for the first two wave trains and then progressively eroded until, at the end of the trials, the crust was completely eroded. However, portions of the toe wall remained intact at the end of the experiment and appear to have inhibited undercutting of the slope. The results of the experiment suggest that coastal erosion can be mitigated by construction of an EICP-stabilized toe wall to protect against undercutting of a slope and that it may be possible to construct a surficial EICP barrier of sufficient thickness to reduce slope erosion to a minimum, depending on the magnitude of the wave load.},

  abstract = {Plume-surface interaction (PSI) effects during propulsive landing are a major risk factor in the development of larger human class Mars and Moon landers. The NASA/MSFC Fluid Dynamics Branch is applying a framework of PSI simulation tools to predict plume impingement flow, plume-induced erosion and cratering, and debris transport to deliver PSI environments to NASA and commercial customer projects. The Loci/CHEM program is applied in predicting the plume flow and impingement environments with high-fidelity moving body simulation capabilities for lander terminal descent PSI analyses. The gas-granular flow solver (GGFS) multi-phase flow solver enables simulations of particle flows of complex extra-terrestrial regolith materials subject to lander plume-surface interaction to capture surface regolith erosion, cratering, crater induced upward flow redirection, ejecta streams, and dust cloud lofting. The NASA debris transport analysis (DTA) toolset is applied to post-process the simulations and predict debris transport risks to the lander and define farfield stay-out zones. An overview of current capabilities of these tools and efforts to extend the existing tool capabilities to capture the more complex mixed continuum-rarefied flow in a lunar vacuum is presented. The simulation tool components are currently being brought to application readiness for project support under a project awarded by the NASA game changing development (GCD) program. The tools will be further improved, fully implemented and matured to application readiness, and validated against existing and new PSI experimental data to be generated under the project. Recent NASA program application examples including Mars InSight lander and Apollo Lunar Module plume-surface interaction predictions are presented.},

  abstract = {The end goal of this research is to develop a method for controlling runoff erosion in the sandy, sloping ground using enzyme induced carbonate precipitation (EICP). The EICP is a soil improvement technique that uses urea hydrolysis catalyzed by urease enzyme to precipitate calcium carbonate and cement soil grains. This paper describes an experimental feasibility study at the bench scale of EICP-treated sands under simulated rainfall and 3H:1V slope. Two natural poorly graded clean sands were tested. Block specimens were used to compare the cementation obtained with laboratory-grade urease and crude extract urease. Plot specimens were used to assess the mass loss under rainfall intensities of 76.2 and 114.3~mm/h in 20-min simulated rain events. The level of cementation of the specimens prepared with the crude extract was similar to the cementation obtained with laboratory-grade enzyme. The results of the preliminary bench-scale test showed that the EICP treatment has potential to reduce considerably the soil erosion. Future work will consider larger plot sizes, revised test setup, and greater rainfall intensity and/or droplet size.},

  abstract = {Scour processes downstream of hydraulic structures are challenging problems in hydraulic engineering. Many studies were carried out in the past, and others have been recently conducted to assess the effects of hydraulic and geometric parameters on the scour phenomena caused by plunging jets. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no studies dealing with jet-driven scour processes under unsteady flow conditions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to contribute to fill this gap of knowledge, presenting a preliminary analysis of the static equilibrium configuration (i.e.,~the equilibrium morphology when the jet action ceases). To this end, we conducted an experimental campaign varying jet discharge during each test. More specifically, for unsteady tests different hydrographs were simulated. In addition, reference tests were conducted under steady flow conditions. We found that static equilibrium configurations under unsteady flow conditions are significantly different from the reference counterpart (i.e.,~under steady conditions). Namely, both the water depth and the characteristics of the inflow hydrograph influence the static equilibrium morphology. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that under unsteady flow conditions and for low water depths, the scour hole is deeper than the reference tests. The opposite occurs for higher water depths. Overall, our preliminary analysis provides interesting insights on static scour features caused by plunging jets under both steady and unsteady conditions. Nevertheless, further analyses are required to assess the effect of jet characteristics on the dynamic equilibrium morphology.},

  abstract = {This study gives a comprehensive review on the smart rock technology to monitor local scour depth of bridge piers or abutments, which was originally proposed by our group in 2015. The smart rock is one or more stacked magnets encased in a concrete ball that can automatically roll to the deepest point of a scour hole around a bridge pier and provide its location through remote measurement over time. As of today, three types of spherical smart rocks designated as arbitrarily oriented system (AOS), automatically pointing south system (APSS), and automatically pointing upward system (APUS) have been developed. This study gives a comprehensive review on the smart rock technology for local scour monitoring of bridge piers, in terms of sensing principle, advantages and disadvantages, localization algorithm, effective monitoring range, as well as field test. The smart rock technology was also compared with other technology to monitor bridge scour such as optical fiber sensor, ground penetration radar, sonar, magnetic sliding collar, and so on.},
